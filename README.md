Reinforcement Learning--MCTS
========

# Monte Carlo Tree Search Based Traffic Control
In this project, I use MCTS method on traffic control problem, where the state is the traffic state that recording vehicle locations and traffic light status. The action is binary: either tune the light to next state or keep current status, where I assume the traffic light order is always fixed following green->yellow->red->green circle.

# Traffic Simulation
The project works on Cell Transmission Model(CTM) which can simulate some basic traffic phenomina such as traffic wave and congestion. 

# Project Brief Description
This is a course project of CS34 in Origin State University.
